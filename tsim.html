                        <div class="row justify-content-left" id="para1">
                            Before deciding to go back to school for Multimedia Design and Development, I worked at an Optometrist office for a few years. 
                            The medical field was a passion of mine for a while, but I always felt like something was missing. Working on this project was 
                            a great medley of both of my skills. Combining both my knowledge of design and optometry really helped the design process run 
                            very smoothly. 
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Dr. Kenneth Tsim & Associates have been in business for over 11 years and have established themselves within their community. 
                            Shocking enough their current website was as old as the business! Upon viewing the website it was very clear that it needed
                            revamping. This project consisted of planning and executing the website from scratch.

                            Audience and Target
                        </h3>
                        <div class="row justify-content-left" id="para1">
                            The audience and target market would be new potential patients. Very few individuals use the 
                            phone book nowadays, so where do they go to find a new doctor or clinic? They tend to go on Google and 
                            search for doctors around their area. A website can either make you or break you because that is the 
                            patient's first impression they have of your business. The secondary target market would be returning 
                            patients because they can book their appointments directly on the website.

                            When first meeting with the clients they definitely wanted to update their website while still keeping true to 
                            their brand and professionalism. For the new website I wanted to make the design simple and easy to 
                            use while still focusing on key aspects of the business. The original design included a great deal 
                            of text; however, as a designer I informed the clients that the user is most likely not going to read 
                            all that text (unless they want to know that information). In the new design, there is a bit of text 
                            which I made very brief in order for the user to not feel like they were bombarded by information. Keeping 
                            in mind that the typography had to be clear and large enough that even elderly patients could read it.

                            When having clients who are not sure what they truly want and are giving you free reign of their website 
                            it was really important for me to have an iterative design. Each decision was discussed and tested Before
                            incorporating the improvements on the final design. I created prototypes and using Adobe XD, in order for 
                            the client to test out the user flow.
