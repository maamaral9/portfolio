                            It is difficult enough to go shopping at a mall and having to go into each store individually. You may need to buy yourself some 
                            shoes, a new dress, possibly an outfit for your significant other, oh yeah and don't forget to pick up some essentials for your home.
                            Look no further because Delilah Fashion has everything you need and more! 
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            When I was younger I would go to the mall with my friends and we could go shopping (or window shopping) for hours and hours. Unfortunately,
                            as I grew older I noticed that my energy and patience for shopping diminished. When speaking with friends and family they too could not 
                            shop like they used to and I believe that's why online shopping is booming. Shopping from the comfort of your own home and in your pajamas?
                            Count me in. That's why I wanted to design this company because not only does Delilah Fashion offer online shopping it also has everything 
                            you need for the family. Some categories consist of: Men's clothing, women's clothing, baby and children clothing, accessories, home
                            essentials and much more!

                            Looking at fashion companies that have survived throughout the years, it is clear what works and what does not. These stores mainly sell 
                            male, female, children and home essentials. When designing this store from scratch I really wanted to combine all of these elements into 
                            one clean package. Our main competitors would be Hudson's Bay and Nordstrom because they are department stores that offer designer names 
                            at lower than average prices.

                            Of course it would be great to target everyone; however, it was quite clear that the target audience would be male/females between the ages
                            of 25-40 years of age. Individuals who are not afraid to make a bold wardrobe statement and willing to spend a pretty penny on items they 
                            will love and cherish. Whether they are shopping for themselves, their homes, a loved one or just wanting to stay in style with their 
                            favourite brands: Delilah is the place to shop.

                            Delilah Fashion is a very vibrant, fun and friendly company. These colours definitely represent that because they are 
                            very inviting and bright, yet sophisticated. The primary colour of peach is very trendy and can be admired by any 
                            gender. The typeface Riesling used for the logo has large counters which allows the logo to breathe and appear more 
                            pleasing to the eye. The Oswald typeface is used for the body content which makes it easy to read on smaller devices.

                            My main priority is making the user flow very simple and easy to use. When the user visits the landing page they are immediately 
                            shown the most featured categories. If a user knows exactly what he/she is looking for they have the search button located 
                            on the bottom right corner of the screen. The easier the app is for the user the faster they can locate the item they are looking for 
                            and check out. If the process is quick and painless to use then you can expect to see a returning customer. Another way of securing 
                            a returning customer is having the user create a login. At Delilah Fashion, if the customer creates a login they will obtain their 
                            digital VIP card, keep track of their rewards, manage order history and create a profile so that "saved items" can be retrieved easily.
